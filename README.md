# Image-classification

Using the python libraries : matplotlib, numpy
I have tried to implement image classification using the logic: Read the image, with RGB Tuple save it's red green and blue values for all the different types of images. Then I used the K Neighbors classification to predict new image. 
The code in this repository explains in detail.
